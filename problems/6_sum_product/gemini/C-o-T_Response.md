Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution based on the programming specification.

## Chain of Thought
### 1. Analyze the Goal: 
The function sum_product needs to take a list of integers (numbers) and return a single tuple containing two integers: the sum of all numbers in the list and the product of all numbers in the list.

### 2. Identify Inputs and Outputs:

- Input: numbers: List[int]
- Output: Tuple[int, int], where the first element is the sum and the second is the product.

### 3. Handle the General Case (Non-Empty List):

- To calculate the sum, I need to iterate through the list and add each number to an accumulating variable (a "sum accumulator").
- To calculate the product, I need to iterate through the list and multiply each number by an accumulating variable (a "product accumulator").
- A single for loop can handle both operations simultaneously.

### 4. Handle the Edge Case (Empty List):

- The specification explicitly states: "Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1."
- This gives us the required initial values for our accumulators.
- The sum accumulator (let's call it total_sum) must start at 0.
- The product accumulator (let's call it total_product) must start at 1.
- Why? 0 is the additive identity (anything + 0 = anything). 1 is the multiplicative identity (anything * 1 = anything).

### 5.  Combine General and Edge Cases:
- If I initialize total_sum = 0 and total_product = 1, what happens if the input list numbers is empty?
- The for loop (e.g., for num in numbers:) will not execute even once.
- The function will proceed directly to the return statement.
- It will return (total_sum, total_product), which will be (0, 1).
- This perfectly matches the doctest: sum_product([]) -> (0, 1).
- Therefore, no special if check is needed for the empty list. The initialization strategy correctly handles both the empty list and the non-empty list.

### 6. Develop the Algorithm:
- Define the function sum_product that accepts numbers.
- Initialize a variable total_sum to 0.
- Initialize a variable total_product to 1.
- Loop through each num in the numbers list.
- Inside the loop, update total_sum by adding num to it (total_sum += num).
- Inside the loop, update total_product by multiplying num into it (total_product *= num).
- After the loop finishes (or if it never started), return the tuple (total_sum, total_product).

### 7. Final Code Implementation: 
This algorithm directly translates into the Python code.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a 
    sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    
    # Initialize the sum to 0 (the additive identity).
    # This ensures that if the list is empty, the sum is 0.
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Initialize the product to 1 (the multiplicative identity).
    # This ensures that if the list is empty, the product is 1.
    total_product = 1
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Accumulate the sum
        total_sum += num
        # Accumulate the product
        total_product *= num
        
    # Return the final accumulated values as a tuple
    return (total_sum, total_product)
```
