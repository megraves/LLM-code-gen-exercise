Sorry — I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought. I can, however, give the correct solution and a concise, non-sensitive summary of the approach and examples.

Short summary of approach:
Initialize s = 0 and p = 1. For each integer in the list add it to s and multiply it into p. Return (s, p). This naturally satisfies the empty-list requirements (s=0, p=1).
