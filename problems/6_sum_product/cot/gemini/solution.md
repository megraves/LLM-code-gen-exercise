To address this programming problem, I'll need to develop five distinct Python functions, all adhering to the provided specification: calculating the **sum** and **product** of a list of integers, returning them as a **tuple** `(sum, product)`. Crucially, an empty list must yield a sum of $0$ and a product of $1$.

This is a classic problem that can be solved using various approaches, primarily differentiating by how the list iteration and aggregation are performed. I will explore solutions using:

1.  A standard **`for` loop** with explicit initialization.
2.  The built-in **`sum()`** function and a **`for` loop** for the product.
3.  The **`functools.reduce()`** function for both sum and product.
4.  A **recursive** approach.
5.  A **list comprehension** to handle the product calculation (less common but demonstrates an alternative).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for each function's design:

## Chain of Thought

### func1: Standard `for` Loop Iteration

This is the most fundamental and explicit way to solve the problem.

1.  **Initialization:** Initialize `total_sum = 0` and `total_product = 1`. This directly satisfies the requirement for an empty list: if the loop doesn't run, the function returns $(0, 1)$.
2.  **Iteration:** Loop through each `number` in the input `numbers` list.
3.  **Aggregation:** In each iteration, update `total_sum += number` and `total_product *= number`.
4.  **Return:** Return the tuple `(total_sum, total_product)`.

### func2: Using `sum()` and a Product Loop

Leveraging Python's built-in functionality simplifies the sum calculation.

1.  **Sum Calculation:** Calculate the sum directly using `total_sum = sum(numbers)`. The `sum()` function naturally handles the empty list case by returning $0$.
2.  **Product Initialization:** Initialize `total_product = 1`.
3.  **Product Iteration:** Use a standard `for` loop to calculate the product, similar to func1.
4.  **Return:** Return the tuple `(total_sum, total_product)`.

### func3: Using `functools.reduce`

The `reduce` function from the `functools` module is perfect for aggregating a list into a single value, making it suitable for both sum and product.

1.  **Import:** Need to import `reduce` from `functools` and the `operator` module for the functions `add` and `mul`.
2.  **Sum with `reduce`:** Calculate the sum using `reduce(operator.add, numbers, 0)`. The optional third argument (`0`) is the initializer, ensuring that an empty list returns $0$.
3.  **Product with `reduce`:** Calculate the product using `reduce(operator.mul, numbers, 1)`. The initializer is set to $1$ for the empty product requirement.
4.  **Return:** Return the tuple of the two `reduce` results.

### func4: Recursive Approach

A recursive solution calculates the result by breaking the list down into the first element and the rest of the list (the sub-problem).

1.  **Base Case:** If the list is empty (`if not numbers:`), return the required base case: $(0, 1)$.
2.  **Recursive Step:**
    a.  Recursively call `sum_product` on the tail of the list: `tail_sum, tail_product = sum_product(numbers[1:])`.
    b.  The result for the full list is:
    \* `current_sum = numbers[0] + tail_sum`
    \* `current_product = numbers[0] * tail_product`
3.  **Return:** Return `(current_sum, current_product)`.

### func5: Combining `sum()` and a Generator/Comprehension Product

This solution uses `sum()` for simplicity and attempts a slightly less conventional approach for the product to demonstrate diversity, using a product-calculating loop that is concise, or perhaps by checking the length first. I'll stick to a simple `sum()` and then use a conditional expression for a concise product loop.

1.  **Sum Calculation:** `total_sum = sum(numbers)`.
2.  **Product Initialization/Check:** If the list is empty, the product must be $1$. If it's not empty, we can calculate the product.
3.  **Product Calculation (Using a loop but wrapped for conciseness):** Since Python doesn't have a built-in `product()` function, we'll use a simple loop within the function body, but make the overall structure distinct from func1 and func2 by using an **explicit length check** first.
      * If `len(numbers) == 0`, `total_product = 1`.
      * Else, calculate the product via a loop.
