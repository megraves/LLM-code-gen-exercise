That's a fantastic approach that emphasizes planning and modular execution! I will first lay out the complete plan, breaking the problem down into distinct algorithmic sub-problems. Then, I will execute the sub-problems by generating the five different function implementations, and finally compile them into the complete Python file.

Here is the complete solution in one Python file.

This file contains the complete plan in the initial comments, followed by the execution of the five sub-problems, each resulting in a distinct, working function (`func1` through `func5`).

```python
"""
PLANNING PHASE: Deconstructing the Problem

Problem: Given a list (l), return a new list containing only the unique elements of l, sorted ascendingly.
Example: [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] -> [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]

Intermediate Steps (Execution of Sub-Problems):

1. Sub-Problem 1 (func1): Implement the most idiomatic Python solution using built-in hashing (`set`) followed by sorting.
2. Sub-Problem 2 (func2): Implement a uniqueness check using the properties of dictionaries (`dict.fromkeys`) followed by sorting.
3. Sub-Problem 3 (func3): Implement a manual, procedural approach using a loop and explicit membership checking (`in`) for uniqueness, followed by sorting.
4. Sub-Problem 4 (func4): Implement an efficient solution using sorting followed by the `itertools.groupby` function to find unique, consecutive groups.
5. Sub-Problem 5 (func5): Implement a non-set/non-dict solution by first sorting the list and then iterating through it, keeping only elements different from the previous one.

FINAL ANSWER: A Python file containing all five functions and necessary imports.
