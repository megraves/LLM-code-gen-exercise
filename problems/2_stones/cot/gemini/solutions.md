The core problem is to generate a list of $n$ numbers, where the first number is $n$, and subsequent numbers increment by **2**. This is an **arithmetic progression** with the first term $a_1 = n$ and common difference $d = 2$.

The $i$-th term (level $i$) of this sequence (where $i$ goes from 1 to $n$) is given by the formula:
$$a_i = a_1 + (i-1)d = n + 2(i-1)$$

The problem statement's condition about odd/even numbers is naturally satisfied by this progression:

  * If $n$ is odd, the sequence is $\text{odd}, \text{odd}+2, \text{odd}+4, \ldots$, which are all consecutive odd numbers starting from $n$.
  * If $n$ is even, the sequence is $\text{even}, \text{even}+2, \text{even}+4, \ldots$, which are all consecutive even numbers starting from $n$.

Here are five different solutions to implement the `make_a_pile(n)` function.

## Func1: Iterative Loop

This is the most straightforward solution, using a simple `for` loop to build the list iteratively.

```python
def func1_make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Iterative solution using a for loop and list append.
    """
    pile = []
    current_stones = n
    for _ in range(n):
        pile.append(current_stones)
        current_stones += 2
    return pile
```

-----

## Func2: List Comprehension with Arithmetic Formula

This solution uses a **list comprehension** combined with the direct formula for the $i$-th term of the arithmetic progression.

```python
def func2_make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Solution using a list comprehension and the arithmetic progression formula:
    a_i = n + 2 * i, where i goes from 0 to n-1.
    """
    # i represents the index, starting from 0.
    # The number of stones is n + 2 * (index)
    return [n + 2 * i for i in range(n)]
```

-----

## Func3: Using Python's `range()` with a Start and Step

Python's built-in `range()` function can generate sequences with a specified start, stop, and step. This problem is perfectly suited for it. The sequence starts at $n$ and has a step of $2$. We need $n$ elements.

The last element is $a_n = n + 2(n-1) = 3n - 2$. The `stop` parameter for `range()` is exclusive, so we need to set it to $a_n + 2 = 3n$.

```python
def func3_make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Solution using the built-in range() function with a step size of 2, 
    then converting the range object to a list.
    """
    # start=n, step=2. stop is set to 3*n to ensure the last element (n + 2*(n-1) = 3n - 2) is included.
    return list(range(n, 3 * n, 2))
```

-----

## Func4: Using `itertools.islice` with `itertools.count`

This approach leverages the `itertools` module, which is efficient for handling infinite iterators.

1.  **`itertools.count(n, 2)`**: Creates an infinite iterator that starts at $n$ and increments by $2$.
2.  **`itertools.islice(iterator, stop)`**: Slices the iterator to take the first $n$ elements.
3.  **`list(...)`**: Converts the resulting iterator slice into a list.

<!-- end list -->

```python
import itertools

def func4_make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Solution using itertools.count to generate the sequence and 
    itertools.islice to take exactly n elements.
    """
    # Starts at n, steps by 2, takes the first n elements.
    return list(itertools.islice(itertools.count(n, 2), n))
```

-----

## Func5: Recursive Solution (Memoization Optional)

This solution uses **recursion**. The base case is when $n=1$, returning a list containing only $[1]$. For $n>1$, the result is the recursive call for $n-1$, with the new last element appended. The last element must be the first element of the $n$-level pile, plus $2(n-1)$.

Let $P(n)$ be the list for $n$ levels.
$$P(n) = P(n-1) + [n + 2(n-1)] \quad \text{if } n \text{ is the starting number for the sequence}$$
However, the problem requires the sequence starting with **$n$**.

Let $L(n)$ be the last element of the sequence for an $n$-level pile: $L(n) = n + 2(n-1) = 3n-2$.

The function can be defined as:

  * Base Case: $\text{func}(1) = [1]$
  * Recursive Step: $\text{func}(n) = \text{func}(n-1) + [L(n)]$

Wait, the prompt means $n$ is the *number of levels* AND the *number of stones in the first level*.
Let's trace:
$\text{make\_a\_pile}(3) = [3, 5, 7]$.
$\text{make\_a\_pile}(2) = [2, 4]$.
$\text{make\_a\_pile}(1) = [1]$.

A simpler recursive relationship is based on building the sequence *down* to the base case:

  * The sequence for $n$ levels starts with $n$.
  * The remaining $n-1$ levels form an arithmetic sequence starting at $n+2$.

<!-- end list -->

```python
def func5_make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Recursive solution.
    """
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    
    # The list for n levels starts with n, 
    # followed by a sequence of n-1 levels starting at n+2.
    # The first level has n stones.
    # The second level has n+2 stones.
    # The third level has n+4 stones, etc.
    
    # We can't easily recurse *on the size* because the start value changes.
    # Let's use the iterative-like structure within the recursion.
    
    if n == 0:  # Base case for safety/completion, though n is positive
        return []
    
    # The last element will be n + 2*(n-1)
    last_element = 3 * n - 2
    
    # The sequence for n levels is the sequence for n-1 levels, plus the last element.
    # This requires an auxiliary function or calculation because the start value is 'n'.
    # A cleaner recursion is by using the first element and building the list.
    
    # Recursive solution that builds the result:
    
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
        
    return func5_make_a_pile(n - 1) + [n + 2 * (n - 1)]

# NOTE: The definition of func5_make_a_pile(n) needs adjustment 
# if it is called recursively to maintain the original problem's logic.
# The clearest recursive definition is one that builds the list from the end.
# make_a_pile(3) = make_a_pile(2) + [7]
# make_a_pile(2) = make_a_pile(1) + [4]
# make_a_pile(1) = [1]
# This requires knowing the last element's value (3n-2) without *recalculating* the whole pile.

# Redefined Func5 to be correct:
