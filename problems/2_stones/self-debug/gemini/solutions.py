# --- General Debugging Review Summary ---

# 1. func1 (Iterative Formula):
#    - Review: **Robust and explicit**. Directly implements the math formula.
#    - Bug Risk: Low. Only potential bug is off-by-one in the (i-1) calculation if range is wrong. (Correct)
# 
# 2. func2 (Iterative Update):
#    - Review: **Clear and efficient** for large n as it avoids multiplication in the loop.
#    - Bug Risk: Low. The logic of starting at 'n' and adding 2 repeatedly is correct.
#
# 3. func3 (List Comprehension):
#    - Review: **Concise and Pythonic**. Same logic as func1 but in one line.
#    - Bug Risk: Low. Relies on the same correct formula.
# 
# 4. func4 (itertools):
#    - Review: **Functional approach**. Excellent for demonstrating knowledge of `itertools`.
#    - Bug Risk: Moderate. Incorrect use of `islice` arguments (start, stop, step) or forgetting the final `list()` conversion could break it. (Correct usage: `islice(iterable, stop)`)
#
# 5. func5 (range):
#    - Review: **Most optimized for speed**, using a highly optimized C-implemented built-in function.
#    - Bug Risk: High. The crucial part is correctly calculating the **exclusive stop value** ($3n$). A common mistake is using the last term ($3n-2$) as the stop value. (Correct: $3n$)
