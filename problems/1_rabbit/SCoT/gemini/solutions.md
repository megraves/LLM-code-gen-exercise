This problem asks us to determine the total number of carrots eaten and the number of remaining carrots after a rabbit tries to eat a required amount, given its current eaten count and the available stock.

## Understanding the Input and Goal

The function `eat(number, need, remaining)` takes three integers:

1.  **`number`**: Carrots already eaten.
2.  **`need`**: Carrots the rabbit *needs* to eat now.
3.  **`remaining`**: Carrots available in stock.

The goal is to return a list (or array) of two integers:

1.  The **total number of eaten carrots** after the meal.
2.  The **number of carrots left** in the stock.

The core logic revolves around comparing the **`need`** with the **`remaining`** stock.

### Key Logic:

1.  **Sufficient Stock ($\text{remaining} \ge \text{need}$):**

      * The rabbit eats exactly $\text{need}$ carrots.
      * **New Eaten Total:** $\text{number} + \text{need}$
      * **New Remaining Stock:** $\text{remaining} - \text{need}$

2.  **Insufficient Stock ($\text{remaining} < \text{need}$):**

      * The rabbit eats all $\text{remaining}$ carrots.
      * **New Eaten Total:** $\text{number} + \text{remaining}$
      * **New Remaining Stock:** $0$

This conditional logic can be implemented in several ways.

## Solution 1: func1 (Basic Conditional)

This is the most straightforward implementation using a standard `if/else` block based on the comparison of `need` and `remaining`.

```python
def func1(number, need, remaining):
    """
    Uses a basic if/else statement to check if the remaining stock
    is sufficient to meet the need.
    """
    if remaining >= need:
        # Sufficient stock: rabbit eats all it needs
        eaten_total = number + need
        left = remaining - need
    else:
        # Insufficient stock: rabbit eats all remaining
        eaten_total = number + remaining
        left = 0
        
    return [eaten_total, left]
```

## Solution 2: func2 (Amount Eaten Variable)

Instead of recalculating the *eaten* and *left* variables in each branch, we can first determine the **actual amount eaten** (`eaten_now`) and then use this amount to calculate the final results. The amount eaten now is $\min(\text{need}, \text{remaining})$.

```python
def func2(number, need, remaining):
    """
    Determines the amount eaten now using min(), then calculates total eaten
    and remaining stock based on that amount.
    """
    # The rabbit eats the smaller of what it needs and what is available
    eaten_now = min(need, remaining)
    
    # Calculate the outputs based on the amount eaten_now
    eaten_total = number + eaten_now
    left = remaining - eaten_now
    
    return [eaten_total, left]
```

-----

## Solution 3: func3 (Ternary Operator)

This is a more concise version of **Solution 1** using Python's conditional expression (ternary operator) to select between the two possible output lists.

```python
def func3(number, need, remaining):
    """
    Uses Python's conditional expression (ternary operator) to return
    the correct list based on the sufficiency of the remaining stock.
    """
    return (
        [number + need, remaining - need]  # Case: sufficient stock (remaining >= need)
        if remaining >= need 
        else [number + remaining, 0]      # Case: insufficient stock
    )
```

## Solution 4: func4 (Pre-calculate "Deficit")

We can reframe the problem by calculating the **deficit** ($\text{need} - \text{remaining}$). If the deficit is positive, the remaining stock is insufficient. We can use $\max(0, \text{need} - \text{remaining})$ to calculate how many *fewer* carrots the rabbit ate than needed, which simplifies the final calculation of the remaining stock.

```python
def func4(number, need, remaining):
    """
    Calculates the 'shortfall' (how many fewer carrots were eaten than needed)
    to determine the number of carrots left.
    """
    
    # Calculate how many carrots the rabbit needed but *couldn't* eat.
    # If remaining >= need, this shortfall is 0.
    shortfall = max(0, need - remaining)
    
    # Total carrots left:
    # If remaining >= need: remaining - (need - 0)
    # If remaining < need: remaining - remaining = 0
    left = remaining - (need - shortfall) 
    
    # Total eaten:
    # Carrots eaten now is need - shortfall
    eaten_now = need - shortfall
    eaten_total = number + eaten_now
    
    return [eaten_total, left]
```

## Solution 5: func5 (Functional Approach with $\min$)

Similar to **Solution 2**, this approach uses the $\min$ function but avoids intermediate variables by calculating both the total eaten and remaining values directly within the function body, making it the most compact and mathematically direct solution.

```python
def func5(number, need, remaining):
    """
    The most concise solution, using the min() function to directly
    determine the amount eaten and calculate the two results simultaneously.
    """
    # Amount eaten now is the minimum of what is needed and what is available
    eaten_now = min(need, remaining)
    
    return [
        number + eaten_now,    # Total carrots eaten
        remaining - eaten_now  # Total carrots left
    ]
```
