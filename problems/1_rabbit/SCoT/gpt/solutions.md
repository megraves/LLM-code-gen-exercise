Perfect! Let's solve this **step by step**, structured and organized, and then implement **5 different solutions** labeled `func1` through `func5`.

## Step 1: Understand the input and output

**Inputs:**

1. `number`: carrots already eaten
2. `need`: carrots rabbit wants to eat
3. `remaining`: carrots available

**Outputs:** a list `[total_eaten, remaining_after_eating]`

**Logic:**

* If `remaining >= need`, rabbit can eat all `need` carrots:

  * `total_eaten = number + need`
  * `remaining_after_eating = remaining - need`
* If `remaining < need`, rabbit eats all remaining:

  * `total_eaten = number + remaining`
  * `remaining_after_eating = 0`

**Example:**

* `eat(5, 6, 10)` → `[11, 4]` (enough remaining carrots)
* `eat(2, 11, 5)` → `[7, 0]` (not enough remaining carrots)

## Step 2: Plan different approaches

We can solve this in **multiple ways**:

1. **Simple if/else** → direct comparison.
2. **Using `min()` function** → select the smaller of `need` and `remaining`.
3. **Using `max()` function** → subtract and use max to avoid negatives.
4. **Using conditional expression (ternary)** → inline calculation.
5. **Using `min()` and tuple unpacking** → compute both values in one line.

## Step 3: Implement 5 solutions

```python
# Solution 1: Simple if/else
def func1(number, need, remaining):
    if remaining >= need:
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else:
        return [number + remaining, 0]

# Solution 2: Using min()
def func2(number, need, remaining):
    eaten = min(need, remaining)
    return [number + eaten, remaining - eaten]

# Solution 3: Using max() to avoid negative remaining
def func3(number, need, remaining):
    eaten = min(need, remaining)
    remaining_after = max(remaining - need, 0)
    return [number + eaten, remaining_after]

# Solution 4: Using conditional expression (ternary)
def func4(number, need, remaining):
    return [number + need, remaining - need] if remaining >= need else [number + remaining, 0]

# Solution 5: Using min() and tuple unpacking
def func5(number, need, remaining):
    eaten = min(need, remaining)
    total, remaining_after = number + eaten, remaining - eaten
    return [total, remaining_after]
```

✅ **Step 4: Test examples**

```python
print(func1(5, 6, 10))  # [11, 4]
print(func2(4, 8, 9))   # [12, 1]
print(func3(1, 10, 10)) # [11, 0]
print(func4(2, 11, 5))  # [7, 0]
print(func5(3, 2, 1))   # [4, 0]
```

All functions return correct results.

If you want, I can **also make a super concise one-liner version** that fits all five solutions in **one line each** using just arithmetic and `min()`/`max()`.

Do you want me to do that next?
