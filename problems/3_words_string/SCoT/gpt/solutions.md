Let's tackle this step by step. First, we assess the problem, inputs, outputs, and inner logic, then create multiple solutions.

---

### **Problem Understanding**

**Input:**

* A string `s` that contains words separated by **commas**, **spaces**, or both.

**Output:**

* A list of individual words with all commas and extra spaces removed.

**Inner Logic:**

1. Remove commas and extra spaces.
2. Split the string into words.
3. Return the list of words.

**Example Tests:**

* `"Hi, my name is John"` → `["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]`
* `"One, two, three, four, five, six"` → `["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]`

### **Solution Approaches**

#### **func1 – Using `replace` and `split`**

```python
def func1(s):
    s_clean = s.replace(",", "")  # remove commas
    return s_clean.split()        # split by spaces
```

---

#### **func2 – Using `re.split` with regex**

```python
import re

def func2(s):
    return re.split(r'[,\s]+', s.strip())  # split by comma or whitespace
```

---

#### **func3 – Using list comprehension and `split`**

```python
def func3(s):
    words = []
    for word in s.replace(",", " ").split():
        if word:
            words.append(word)
    return words
```

---

#### **func4 – Using `filter` and `split`**

```python
def func4(s):
    return list(filter(None, s.replace(",", " ").split()))
```

---

#### **func5 – Using `re.findall` to directly extract words**

```python
import re

def func5(s):
    return re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', s)
```

---

All of these handle both spaces and commas and produce the expected list of words.

If you want, I can make a **single-file version** with all five functions together, ready to run. Do you want me to do that?
