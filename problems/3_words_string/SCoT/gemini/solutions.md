That's a great problem\! Dealing with strings that have multiple delimiters is a common task. I'll provide five distinct Python solutions, following your structured approach of assessing the specification, understanding the logic, and then implementing the code.

## Problem Analysis

### Input Definition

The input is a single string `s` containing words. The words can be separated by either **commas (`,`)** or **spaces (`     `)**, or a combination of both.

### Output Definition

The output is a **list of strings** (an array in some languages), where each element is one of the original words from the input string.

### Inner Logic

The core task is to **tokenize** the input string. This means:

1.  Handling multiple delimiter types (spaces and commas).
2.  Ensuring that the resulting tokens (words) do not contain the delimiters.
3.  Dealing with potential multiple spaces or a space immediately next to a comma (e.g., `"word, word"` or `"word , word"`).
4.  Filtering out any empty strings that might result from the splitting process (e.g., if there are two spaces together).

### Self-Generated Examples

| Input (`s`) | Expected Output | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `"apple,banana orange,grape"` | `["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]` | Mixed delimiters. |
| `"a b c"` | `["a", "b", "c"]` | Space-separated only. |
| `"1,2,3,4"` | `["1", "2", "3", "4"]` | Comma-separated only. |
| `" test ,case "` | `["test", "case"]` | Handles leading/trailing spaces and spaces around the comma. |
| `",first, second, third,"` | `["first", "second", "third"]` | Handles leading/trailing delimiters/empty strings. |

## Five Solutions for `words_string(s)`

I'll use various Python string and list manipulation techniques, including different standard library modules, to offer distinct approaches.

### func1: Sequential Replace and Split (Simple String Manipulation)

This is the most straightforward, non-module-dependent approach. It converts one delimiter type into the other and then uses the basic `str.split()`.

```python
def func1(s):
    """
    1. Replaces all commas with a single space.
    2. Uses the default str.split(), which handles multiple spaces 
       and automatically filters out resulting empty strings.
    """
    # Step 1: Normalize all delimiters to a single space
    temp_s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    
    # Step 2: Split by space. The default split() handles multiple spaces 
    # and leading/trailing spaces gracefully.
    result = temp_s.split()
    
    return result

```

-----

### func2: Using `re.split()` (Regular Expressions)

The `re` (regular expression) module is specifically designed for complex pattern splitting. We can define a pattern that matches *either* a comma *or* one or more spaces.

```python
import re

def func2(s):
    """
    1. Uses the re.split() function to split the string.
    2. The regex pattern '[, ]+' matches one or more occurrences of either 
       a comma OR a space, acting as the delimiter.
    3. A list comprehension is used to filter out any empty strings that 
       might result from leading/trailing delimiters.
    """
    # Pattern: Match one or more commas (,) OR spaces ( )
    delimiters = r'[, ]+'
    
    # Split the string
    temp_list = re.split(delimiters, s)
    
    # Filter out empty strings that result from leading/trailing delimiters
    result = [word for word in temp_list if word]
    
    return result

```

-----

### func3: Using `itertools.chain.from_iterable` and Splitting

This functional approach first splits the string by one delimiter (e.g., comma), and then takes each resulting piece and splits it by the second delimiter (e.g., space), flattening the result.

```python
from itertools import chain

def func3(s):
    """
    1. Splits the string by the primary delimiter (comma).
    2. Iterates over the resulting list, splitting each item by the 
       secondary delimiter (space).
    3. Uses chain.from_iterable to flatten the list of lists into a 
       single list of words.
    4. Filters out empty strings.
    """
    # Step 1 & 2: Split by comma, then split each resulting piece by space
    intermediate_list = [piece.split() for piece in s.split(',')]
    
    # Step 3: Flatten the list of lists
    result = list(chain.from_iterable(intermediate_list))
    
    # Optional: Filter for robustness, although split() should handle most cases
    return [word for word in result if word]

```

-----

### func4: Two-Pass Cleaning and Splitting

This solution focuses on creating a very clean, consistently space-separated string before the final split. It's a robust manual approach to normalization.

```python
def func4(s):
    """
    1. Replaces commas with spaces.
    2. Iteratively cleans up multiple spaces to single spaces.
    3. Strips leading/trailing spaces.
    4. Splits the clean string by the single space.
    """
    # Step 1: Replace all commas with a single space
    temp_s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    
    # Step 2: Ensure only single spaces exist between words
    # This loop is a common way to replace all occurrences of a multi-char 
    # substring until no more exist.
    while '  ' in temp_s:
        temp_s = temp_s.replace('  ', ' ')
        
    # Step 3: Strip any resulting leading/trailing spaces
    clean_s = temp_s.strip()
    
    # Step 4: Split by the single space
    if not clean_s:
        return []
        
    result = clean_s.split(' ')
    
    return result

```

### func5: Splitting by Space and Then Filtering/Splitting Commas

This method uses the default `str.split()` first, and then handles any remaining commas within the resulting "words."

```python
def func5(s):
    """
    1. Splits by space using default split() to handle multiple spaces.
    2. Iterates over the resulting list.
    3. For any word containing a comma, it splits that word by the comma 
       and adds the resulting pieces to the final list.
    4. This explicitly handles cases like "word1,word2".
    """
    # Step 1: Split by space (robust against multiple spaces)
    space_split_list = s.split()
    
    final_words = []
    
    # Step 2 & 3: Iterate and handle internal commas
    for word_group in space_split_list:
        if ',' in word_group:
            # Split the group by comma and extend the final list
            comma_split_words = [word for word in word_group.split(',') if word]
            final_words.extend(comma_split_words)
        else:
            # If no comma, it's a clean word
            final_words.append(word_group)
            
    return final_words
```
