That's an excellent challenge! Providing multiple solutions is a great way to explore different Python idioms and performance trade-offs.

Here is the plan for developing five distinct, well-commented Python functions to solve the word splitting problem.

### Plan: Five Solutions for `words_string(s)`

The goal is to split a string `s` by two delimiters: the comma (`,`) and the space (` `), ensuring that the resulting list contains only valid words and no empty strings.

| Function | Strategy | Key Python Tool | Robustness to Multiple Delimiters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`func1`** | **Replace & Pythonic Split (Recommended)** | `str.replace` followed by `str.split()` (no argument). | High (Standard `split()` handles arbitrary whitespace sequences). |
| **`func2`** | **Regular Expressions** | `re.split` | High (The regex pattern `[,\s]+` explicitly handles one or more delimiters). |
| **`func3`** | **Explicit Split & Filtering** | `str.replace` followed by `str.split(' ')` and list comprehension filter. | Medium (Relies on replacing `,` with a single ` ` and then explicitly filtering the empties). |
| **`func4`** | **Procedural (Manual Iteration)** | Basic `for` loop and string concatenation. | Medium (Requires careful logic to handle sequence state transitions). |
| **`func5`** | **Functional Grouping** | `itertools.groupby` | High (Groups characters based on whether they are a word character or a delimiter). |

I will now implement these five functions in a single Python file.

I've successfully generated five distinct Python functions (`func1` through `func5`), each employing a different technique to solve the word splitting problem, and included test cases to demonstrate their robustness. The final output confirms that all five methods return the correct result for the given example.
