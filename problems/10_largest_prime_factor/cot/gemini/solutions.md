To find the **largest prime factor** of an integer $n > 1$ (where $n$ is not prime), we need a systematic way to identify its prime factors and track the largest one found so far. The core idea for all solutions will involve iterating through potential divisors and checking if they are prime factors.

Since $n$ is not prime, it must have at least one factor other than 1 and itself, and thus at least one prime factor smaller than or equal to $\sqrt{n}$.

Here are five different algorithmic approaches to solve this problem, implemented in Python:

-----

## **Func1: Trial Division and Max Tracking**

This method iterates through all integers $i$ from 2 up to $\sqrt{n}$. If $i$ divides $n$, it is a factor. We repeatedly divide $n$ by $i$ until $i$ no longer divides it, and keep track of the last (and largest) $i$ that was a factor. If after the loop $n$ is greater than 1, the remaining value of $n$ must be the largest prime factor itself.

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    largest_factor = 1
    i = 2
    temp_n = n  # Use a temporary variable to modify

    # Check for factor 2 first
    if temp_n % 2 == 0:
        largest_factor = 2
        while temp_n % 2 == 0:
            temp_n //= 2

    # Check for odd factors
    i = 3
    # We only need to check up to the square root of the *remaining* temp_n
    while i * i <= temp_n:
        if temp_n % i == 0:
            largest_factor = i
            while temp_n % i == 0:
                temp_n //= i
        i += 2

    # If temp_n is still greater than 1, it must be the largest prime factor
    if temp_n > 1:
        largest_factor = temp_n

    return largest_factor
```

-----

## **Func2: Trial Division with $\sqrt{n}$ Limit and Factor List**

This approach performs trial division up to $\sqrt{n}$, saving all prime factors found into a list. After the loop, if $n$ is still greater than 1, it is added as the final, largest prime factor. The largest element in the list is then returned.

```python
def largest_prime_factor_v2(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    factors = []
    i = 2
    temp_n = n

    while i * i <= temp_n:
        if temp_n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            # Repeatedly divide out the factor
            while temp_n % i == 0:
                temp_n //= i
        i += 1

    # If temp_n remains greater than 1, it's the largest prime factor
    if temp_n > 1:
        factors.append(temp_n)

    # Since we added factors in increasing order, the last one is the largest.
    # However, returning max(factors) is safer if the order weren't guaranteed.
    return factors[-1]
```

-----

## **Func3: Optimized Trial Division with Early Exit**

This is an optimized version of the trial division method. It leverages the property that once a factor is found, $n$ is divided by it, which reduces the upper bound for the search ($\sqrt{n}$). It explicitly tracks the largest factor found.

```python
def largest_prime_factor_v3(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Check for factor 2
    max_prime = 1
    temp_n = n
    
    if temp_n % 2 == 0:
        max_prime = 2
        while temp_n % 2 == 0:
            temp_n //= 2

    # Check for odd factors
    d = 3
    # Check up to sqrt(temp_n)
    while d * d <= temp_n:
        if temp_n % d == 0:
            max_prime = d
            while temp_n % d == 0:
                temp_n //= d
        d += 2

    # The remaining number is the largest prime factor if it's > 1
    if temp_n > 1:
        return temp_n
    
    return max_prime
```

-----

## **Func4: Prime Factor Sieve and Check (Less Efficient for Single Large N)**

This approach first generates a list of primes up to $\sqrt{n}$ using an Eratosthenes-like sieve, and then checks those primes against $n$. It is generally **less efficient** for finding the factors of a *single* large number $n$, but is a distinct approach.

```python
def largest_prime_factor_v4(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    import math

    limit = int(math.sqrt(n))
    
    # 1. Generate primes up to sqrt(n) using a basic sieve
    is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for p in range(2, int(math.sqrt(limit)) + 1):
        if is_prime[p]:
            for i in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):
                is_prime[i] = False
    
    primes = [p for p, is_p in enumerate(is_prime) if is_p]

    # 2. Check these primes against n
    largest_factor = 1
    temp_n = n

    for p in primes:
        if p * p > temp_n: # Optimization: stop if p^2 > remaining temp_n
             break
        
        if temp_n % p == 0:
            largest_factor = p
            while temp_n % p == 0:
                temp_n //= p

    # If temp_n is still > 1, it's the largest prime factor
    if temp_n > 1:
        return temp_n
    
    return largest_factor
```

-----

## **Func5: Recursive Factorization (Conceptual)**

This solution leverages recursion to find a factor and then recursively finds the largest prime factor of the remaining quotient. The function `get_smallest_factor` is a helper function to find the *smallest* prime factor (which is guaranteed to be prime).

```python
def _get_smallest_factor(n: int) -> int:
    """Helper function: Finds the smallest factor of n, or n itself if prime."""
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return 2
    d = 3
    while d * d <= n:
        if n % d == 0:
            return d
        d += 2
    return n # n is prime

def largest_prime_factor_v5(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Base case: if n is prime, it is its own largest prime factor
    smallest_factor = _get_smallest_factor(n)
    
    # Per the problem spec, n is not prime, so smallest_factor < n
    if smallest_factor == n: 
        # This case shouldn't occur based on problem spec, 
        # but handles the base case if the spec were looser
        return n
    
    # Recursive step: smallest_factor is a prime factor.
    # The largest prime factor of n is the largest of 
    # (smallest_factor) and (largest prime factor of n // smallest_factor).
    # Since we are guaranteed to be repeatedly dividing by the smallest factor, 
    # we just need to recurse on the reduced number.
    return largest_prime_factor_v5(n // smallest_factor) 
    # NOTE: This approach has high overhead due to deep recursion and function calls
    # and is primarily shown for conceptual difference.
```

**Note on Func5:** While conceptually distinct and using recursion, it is **highly inefficient** due to function call overhead and is only effective if the recursion depth is small (i.e., $n$ has few prime factors). For the purposes of presenting 5 *different* solutions, it is included, but the iterative solutions (Func1, Func2, Func3) are far superior in practice.
