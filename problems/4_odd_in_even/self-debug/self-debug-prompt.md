Give 5 different solutions for this problem labeled func1 through func5. You are a debugger. After implementing code, you like to look back and debug. Given the programming specification, show us how you code and then debug the functions.

def solution(lst):
"""Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.


Examples
solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12
solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9
solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0
