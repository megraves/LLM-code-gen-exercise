That's a great problem focusing on the nuances of string searching! The key is ensuring that all five solutions correctly handle **overlapping** occurrences.

I will first structure the reasoning and examples, and then provide five distinct Python functions in a single, runnable file.

### Chain of Thoughts

1.  **Analyze the Overlap Requirement:** The standard Python `str.count()` method does not count overlaps (e.g., `'aaaa'.count('aa')` is 2). To count overlaps, the search for the next match must start one position *after* the current match started, rather than after the match has finished.
2.  **Determine Five Distinct Methods:** I will implement five structurally different methods to solve this:
    * **`func1` (Basic Slicing Loop):** The most fundamental way, manually checking every possible start index using string slicing.
    * **`func2` (Iterative `str.find`):** Using Python's built-in `find()` method, but critically advancing the search index by only one position (`+1`) after a match, rather than the length of the substring.
    * **`func3` (Generator Expression/Functional):** A concise, Pythonic way using a generator expression and the `sum()` function, similar to `func1` but condensed.
    * **`func4` (Regular Expressions Lookahead):** Using the `re` module with a non-consuming **positive lookahead assertion** (`(?=...)`) to count matches without consuming the characters, thus enabling overlaps.
    * **`func5` (Recursion):** Solving the problem recursively, where the function calls itself on the rest of the string (`string[1:]`) in every step, ensuring the overlap is always considered.
3.  **Handle Edge Cases:** All functions must handle the case where the substring is longer than the string, and the special case where the `substring` is empty (which should return 0 to avoid infinite or ambiguous results).

### Inputs, Outputs, and Core Reasoning

* **Input (I):** `string` (`str`), `substring` (`str`)
* **Output (O):** An integer representing the count of overlapping and non-overlapping occurrences.
* **Reasoning (R):** The implementations are designed to override the default non-overlapping behavior of standard string counting. This is achieved either by manually stepping the search index by 1 (Functions 1, 2, 3, 5) or by using a non-consuming regex pattern (Function 4).

### Structured Examples

| `string` | `substring` | `len(sub)` | Expected Output | Explanation (Overlaps in bold) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `banana` | `ana` | 3 | 2 | b**ana**na, ban**ana** |
| `aaaaa` | `aa` | 2 | 4 | **aa**aaa, a**aa**aa, aa**aa**a, aaa**aa** |
| `abcabc` | `abc` | 3 | 2 | **abc**abc, abc**abc** |
| `mississippi` | `iss` | 3 | 2 | m**iss**issippi, miss**iss**ippi |
| `abc` | `d` | 1 | 0 | No match. |

I will now generate the Python file containing the five distinct solutions.

I've provided five distinct solutions, each leveraging a different core concept or tool in Python (manual slicing, iterative `find` with offset, generator expression, regex lookahead, and recursion) to correctly handle overlapping substring occurrences. The example tests at the bottom confirm the logic works for the required overlapping cases. Let me know if you'd like to explore optimizations or different string problems!
