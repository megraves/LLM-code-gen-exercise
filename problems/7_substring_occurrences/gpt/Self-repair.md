Let’s walk through this step by step.

---

### 🧩 Step 1: Understanding the specification

We need a function `how_many_times(string, substring)` that counts **all occurrences** of `substring` inside `string`, including **overlapping ones**.

Examples:

* `'aaa'` contains `'a'` three times → output `3`
* `'aaaa'` contains `'aa'` three times (`aa`, `aa`, `aa`) → output `3`
* `''` contains `'a'` → `0` because the string is empty

---

### 🪛 Step 2: Common mistake to avoid

If we used Python’s built-in `.count()` method, it **would not count overlapping substrings**:

```python
"aaaa".count("aa")  # returns 2, but we want 3
```

So we need to handle this manually.

---

### ⚙️ Step 3: Implementation logic

We can loop through every possible starting index and check if the substring matches starting there.

Pseudocode:

```
initialize count = 0
for i in range(0, len(string) - len(substring) + 1):
    if string[i : i + len(substring)] == substring:
        count += 1
return count
```

Also handle edge cases:

* If `substring` is empty → should probably return `0` (not specified, but avoids infinite matches)
* If `substring` is longer than `string` → `0`

---

### ✅ Step 4: Correct Python code

```python
from typing import *

def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlapping cases.
    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """
    if not substring:
        return 0

    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1):
        if string[i:i+len(substring)] == substring:
            count += 1
    return count
```

---

### 🧠 Step 5: Verification

Let’s test:

```python
print(how_many_times('', 'a'))      # 0
print(how_many_times('aaa', 'a'))   # 3
print(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')) # 3
print(how_many_times('abababa', 'aba')) # 3
```

✅ All correct.

### 💡 Summary of process

1. Read the specification and identified overlap requirement.
2. Avoided `.count()` because it ignores overlaps.
3. Wrote a loop checking every starting index.
4. Added edge case handling for empty substring.
5. Verified with examples.

Would you like me to add unit tests for this function using `unittest` or `pytest`?
