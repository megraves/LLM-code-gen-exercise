### Chain of Thoughts

#### 1. Analyze the Request
The user requires a Python function, `flip_case(string: str)`, that iterates through an input string and swaps the case of all alphabetical characters (lowercase to uppercase, and vice versa). Non-alphabetic characters must remain unchanged.

#### 2. Identify the Core Operation
The core task is character-level case inversion. This is a very common operation in string manipulation.

#### 3. Evaluate Pythonic Solutions
Python's `str` class provides several highly optimized methods for case manipulation:
* `str.upper()`: Converts all characters to uppercase.
* `str.lower()`: Converts all characters to lowercase.
* `str.swapcase()`: Converts all uppercase letters to lowercase and all lowercase letters to uppercase. This method precisely matches the specification given in the user's request and is the most efficient solution.

#### 4. Determine Implementation Strategy
The function can be implemented in a single, clean step by using the built-in `swapcase()` method on the input string. This avoids manual iteration and conditional checks (`islower()`, `isupper()`), leading to more readable and performant code.

#### 5. Construct the Function
1.  Define the function signature: `def flip_case(string: str) -> str:`.
2.  Inside the function, apply the method: `return string.swapcase()`.
3.  Include the provided docstring and doctest example for completeness.

This approach satisfies all requirements efficiently.

***

I will generate the Python file containing the `flip_case` function using the efficient `swapcase()` method.

I've generated the `flip_case.py` file, which uses the efficient Python string method `swapcase()` to fulfill the case-flipping requirement. The file includes doctests for verification.
