This is a great problem for exploring different string manipulation techniques in Python. I will provide a step-by-step chain of thought followed by a single Python file containing five distinct solutions, each labeled as requested.

### **Chain of Thought Reasoning**

#### 1. Goal Analysis and Functional Requirement
The core requirement is to create a function `flip_case(string)` that reverses the case of every alphabet character in the input string while leaving all other characters (numbers, punctuation, spaces) unchanged.

#### 2. Strategy 1: The Idiomatic Python Solution (func1)
* **Concept:** Python's built-in `str` class often provides highly optimized methods for common string tasks.
* **Execution:** The `.swapcase()` method is designed to do exactly what the prompt specifies. This is the simplest, cleanest, and most performance-efficient solution in pure Python.

#### 3. Strategy 2: The Pythonic Conditional Iteration (func2)
* **Concept:** Use a list comprehension (or generator expression) combined with the ternary conditional operator (`if/else`) and `str.join()` for an efficient, single-line transformation.
* **Execution:** Iterate through the string. For each character `c`, check if `c.islower()`. If true, convert it to uppercase (`c.upper()`); otherwise, convert it to lowercase (`c.lower()`). The entire sequence is then joined back into a string. *Note: Using `.lower()` as the fallback handles uppercase letters and leaves non-letters (which are neither `.islower()` nor `.isupper()`) unchanged, which is slightly less explicit than using an explicit check, but effective.*

#### 4. Strategy 3: Procedural Loop with Explicit Checks (func3)
* **Concept:** Implement the logic using a traditional `for` loop, explicitly checking the case of each character and building the result using a list and `join` (to avoid inefficient string concatenation).
* **Execution:**
    1.  Initialize an empty list (`result`).
    2.  Loop through the input string character by character.
    3.  If the character is lowercase (`char.islower()`), append its uppercase version to `result`.
    4.  If the character is uppercase (`char.isupper()`), append its lowercase version to `result`.
    5.  If neither, append the original character (non-letter) to `result`.
    6.  Return `"".join(result)`.

#### 5. Strategy 4: Numeric Manipulation using ASCII/Unicode (func4)
* **Concept:** Letters in ASCII/Unicode have a fixed numerical distance (32) between their uppercase and lowercase counterparts (e.g., `ord('a')` is 97, `ord('A')` is 65). We can convert the character to its integer code, perform the math, and convert it back.
* **Execution:**
    1.  Define a helper function that takes a character.
    2.  Use `ord()` to get the character code.
    3.  Check if the code falls into the lowercase range (e.g., 97-122 for basic ASCII/Latin). If so, subtract 32.
    4.  Check if the code falls into the uppercase range (e.g., 65-90). If so, add 32.
    5.  If no range matches, return the original character.
    6.  Apply this helper function to the entire string using `map()` and then join the results.

#### 6. Strategy 5: Regular Expression Substitution (func5)
* **Concept:** Use the `re` module's `re.sub()` function with a custom replacement function. This allows us to target only alphabetic characters using a pattern (`[a-zA-Z]`) and execute custom logic on the match.
* **Execution:**
    1.  Import the `re` module.
    2.  Define a function (or lambda) that receives a regex match object (`m`).
    3.  Inside the function, extract the matched character (`m.group(0)`).
    4.  Apply the case-flipping logic (e.g., check `islower()` and use `upper()`/`lower()`).
    5.  Call `re.sub()` using the pattern `r'[a-zA-Z]'` and the custom replacement function on the input string.

I will now generate the Python file with the five solutions.

I've provided five distinct solutions, ranging from the most concise built-in method (`func1`) to more advanced techniques like regex substitution (`func5`) and low-level code manipulation (`func4`), all contained within the requested single Python file.
